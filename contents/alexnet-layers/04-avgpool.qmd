# AvgPool

Great, now let’s focus on the **`avgpool`** block of AlexNet:

```python
(avgpool): AdaptiveAvgPool2d(output_size=(6, 6))
```

## Overview

###  What is AdaptiveAvgPool2d?

It’s an **average pooling layer** that *automatically adjusts* its kernel size and stride so that the **output has a fixed spatial size** `(6,6)`, no matter what the input size is.

* **Normal pooling (`AvgPool2d`)** → you specify `kernel_size`, `stride`. The output size depends on the input.
* **Adaptive pooling (`AdaptiveAvgPool2d`)** → you specify **desired output size**. PyTorch figures out kernel & stride to make it happen.

 In AlexNet, this ensures that before flattening, the feature map is always **(256, 6, 6)**.

---

###  Why is this needed?

* After the last conv+maxpool, AlexNet (on 224×224 input) gives `(N, 256, 6, 6)` anyway.
* But if your input were larger/smaller (say 256×256), the feature map might be `(N, 256, 7, 7)` or `(N, 256, 5, 5)`.
* `AdaptiveAvgPool2d((6,6))` **guarantees** the output is `(6,6)` regardless of input size.
* This makes the model **more robust** to varying input sizes.

###  What does average pooling mean?

Within each window, instead of taking the **max** (like MaxPool), it takes the **mean** of the values.

Example:

Input (one feature map, 4×4):

```
1  2  3  4
5  6  7  8
9 10 11 12
13 14 15 16
```

If we apply `AdaptiveAvgPool2d((2,2))`, PyTorch divides it into 4 regions and averages each:

```
Top-left   = mean(1,2,5,6)   = 3.5
Top-right  = mean(3,4,7,8)   = 5.5
Bottom-left= mean(9,10,13,14)=11.5
Bottom-right=mean(11,12,15,16)=13.5
```

Output:

```
3.5   5.5
11.5  13.5
```

---

###  In AlexNet

* Input from `features`: `(N, 256, 6, 6)` already.
* `AdaptiveAvgPool2d((6,6))` keeps it the same.
* But if input resolution were different, it would adapt to make sure output is always `(N, 256, 6, 6)`.

---

###  Intuition

Think of it as a **“resizer”** for the feature map:

* CNN extracts features → may give variable sizes
* Adaptive pooling “squeezes” them into a fixed grid (6×6)
* Classifier then always receives the same number of features (`256×6×6 = 9216`).

---

 So in short:
`AdaptiveAvgPool2d((6,6))` = “take whatever feature map you got and average-pool it into exactly **6×6 per channel**,” ensuring fixed-size input for the classifier.
